# Basic C example, using Oculus's VrSdk

Based off of https://github.com/cnlohr/rawdrawandroid

This just does a texture / color background and does NOT do actual VR.  See the OpenXR example for that.

## Want OpenXR Instead?

Use it here: https://github.com/cnlohr/tsopenxr/tree/master/meta_quest

## Installation

1. Download the VrSdk and copy the VrApi folder to this folder.
2. Install Android NDK + SDK [rawdrawandroid](https://github.com/cnlohr/rawdrawandroid).  You can use any of the methods. 
3. You will need to be a "developer" on your headset to enable `adb` on your HMD. You will need to sign up for that program.
4. `make run`
